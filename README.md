This is a python implementation of the game Set using PyQt5. 

If you don't have PyQt5, you can install it with `pip install PyQt5`

After this, run `python set.py` to play.

Traditional hotkeys are supported. Logging is available (please log), which will be used to find out cool trends of humans playing set (if I get enough).
